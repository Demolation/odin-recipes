My first project for The Odin Project

This will be my first project for The Odin Project. The goal is to apply all the HTML knowledge I’ve learned so far. At the same time, I also plan to add my own CSS, even though I haven’t been taught the details yet. This project is also meant to help me become more familiar with HTML.
