        <h2>What is Tiramisu?</h2>
        <p>The word Tiramisu (tirami su in Italian) means “cheer me up” or “pull me up,” which is very appropriate because one bite will put you in a good mood! An authentic Tiramisu dessert that has 2 main layers: sponge cake ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur and the mascarpone cream layer. This classic dessert often contains raw egg yolks, but we use a different process to create a custard-like cream with amazing texture and flavor.</p>
        <p>We love classic Italian desserts like Panna Cotta, Affogato, and let’s not forget the Berry Tiramisu. This classic Tiramisu recipe is probably the most iconic Italian dessert, which is why it’s on the menu in nearly every Italian restaurant. This homemade version does not disappoint!</p>

        <p>Natasha shows how simple it is to make this amazing Italian layered dessert. It’s the best tiramisu recipe because it looks so impressive, tastes amazing, but comes together in only 5 simple steps.</p>

        <h2>Tiramisu Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Our easy tiramisu requires a short list of ingredients, but the combination taste incredible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Espresso or strong coffee</strong> – Use espresso if you have an espresso machine, or use your favorite strong-brewed coffee. See substitutes below.</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Rum</strong> – divided between the cream and the coffee syrup for more depth of flavor. The light color keeps the cream layer lighter in color. See substitutes below.</li>
            <li><strong>ladyfingers</strong> – You don’t want these cookies soft or spongy. Dry and crisp ladyfinger cookies are best to absorb the coffee syrup without falling apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg yolks and sugar</strong> – in step 2, we heat these low and slow to cook the yolks and dissolve the sugar to give the cream layer a great texture</li>
            <li><strong>Mascarpone and Heavy Whipping Cream</strong> – Use chilled right out of the fridge. For the cream, opt for Heavy cream instead of light or regular cream, since these could make the mixture runny.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Can I Substituted the Rum?</h2>
        <p>We used golden rum but you can use the dark rum. You can also substitute the rum with a little Grand Marnier, or ameretto. If you prefer to omit it completely, you can use just leave out the rum or add little bit vanilla extract.</p>
        
        <h2>What are LadyFingers?</h2>
        <p>Lady Fingers are essentially sponge cake batter piped into strips and baked. They are known as "savoiardi" in italian and are perfect for absorbing the syrup for tiramisu. Ladyfingers are great in other no-bake desserts such as the incredible Charlotte Cake, these individual Raspberry Mousse Cup, and even a Berry Triffle. </p>
        <p>Ladyfingers can be found at some grocery stores, like Trader Joe's, Walmart, Albertsons, and World Market, but it's easy to get Ladyfingers online.</p>

        <h2>Can I Substituted the Coffee?</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, coffee or espresso is used in Tiramisu. If you are concerned about caffeine, you can use decaf coffee and still enjoy the same classic flavor. If you prefer a different flavor profile, check out our Berry Tiramisu.</p>

        <h2>What is Mascarpone?</h2>
        <p>Mascarpone is essentially rhe italian version of cream cheese, made of whipped cream, stablilized with an acidic ingredient such as lemon juice or citric acid. Mascarpone cheese has smoother consistency, is milder in flavor, and has twice as much fat as cream cheese. In some cases, you can substitute with cream cheese like in our Tiramisu Yule Log, but the flavor and texture will be different. </p>

        <h2>How to Make Tiramisu</h2>
        <P>Tiramisu is made of 2 basic components – the cream layer and the coffee-soaked ladyfingers. The process is simple:</P>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Quickly dip</strong> half of the ladyfingers in coffee syrup and arrange them in a 9×13 casserole</li>
            <li><strong>In a Heat-Proff Bowl,</strong> whisk together 6 yolks and 3/4 cup sugar. Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (make sure the bowl is over steam and not submerged in water) and continue whisking for 9-10 minutes. It should be lightened in color and no longer grainy when you rub it between your fingers. Remove from steam and whisk for a few minutes to cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>In a seperate bowl,</strong> beat mascarpone and rum together with an electric hand mixer then beat in the cooled yolk mixture until blended.</li>
            <li><strong>Whip</strong> 2 cups cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. With a spatula, fold half into the mascarpone mixture then fold in the remaining half until blended.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread</strong> half of the cream over the first layer of ladyfingers. Dip the remaining ladyfingers and arrange over the cream. Spread on the remaining cream. Cover and refrigerate overnight then dust with cocoa powder and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for the Best Tiramisu</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Do not over-soaked</b> the ladyfingers or the layers may collapse. A quick dip on each side is enough. There will be some syrup left behind.</li>
            <li><b>Water bath</b> - When whisking yolks and sugar over steam, make sure the bowl is not touching the water beneath it.</li>
            <li><b>used cold HEAVY Whipping cream</b> and beat until stiff peaks form - whip slowly over time for cream to remain more stable. Don’t overbeat or it will turn buttery and be difficult to blend. Also avoid under-beating which will keep it from setting properly.</li>
            <li><b>Fold just until combined</b> - when folding cream into mascarpone, do not over-mix the cream or it may turn grainy.</li>
            <li><b>Chill the cake for at least 8 hours in refrigerator or overnight and it will be very easy to slice and serve. Serve the cake cold.</b></li>
            <li><b>Leftovers</b> are good refrigerated for up to 5 days because there are no raw eggs in the cake.</li>
        </ul>
