        <h2>What is Tiramisu?</h2>
        <p>The word Tiramisu (tirami su in Italian) means “cheer me up” or “pull me up,” which is very appropriate because one bite will put you in a good mood! An authentic Tiramisu dessert that has 2 main layers: sponge cake ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur and the mascarpone cream layer. This classic dessert often contains raw egg yolks, but we use a different process to create a custard-like cream with amazing texture and flavor.</p>
        <p>We love classic Italian desserts like Panna Cotta, Affogato, and let’s not forget the Berry Tiramisu. This classic Tiramisu recipe is probably the most iconic Italian dessert, which is why it’s on the menu in nearly every Italian restaurant. This homemade version does not disappoint!</p>

        <h2>Tiramisu Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Our easy tiramisu requires a short list of ingredients, but the combination taste incredible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Espresso or strong coffee</strong> – Use espresso if you have an espresso machine, or use your favorite strong-brewed coffee. See substitutes below.</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Rum</strong> – divided between the cream and the coffee syrup for more depth of flavor. The light color keeps the cream layer lighter in color. See substitutes below.</li>
            <li><strong>ladyfingers</strong> – You don’t want these cookies soft or spongy. Dry and crisp ladyfinger cookies are best to absorb the coffee syrup without falling apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg yolks and sugar</strong> – in step 2, we heat these low and slow to cook the yolks and dissolve the sugar to give the cream layer a great texture</li>
            <li><strong>Mascarpone and Heavy Whipping Cream</strong> – Use chilled right out of the fridge. For the cream, opt for Heavy cream instead of light or regular cream, since these could make the mixture runny.</li>

            <h2>Can I Substituted the Rum?</h2>
            <p>We used golden rum but you can use the dark rum. You can also substitute the rum with a little Grand Marnier, or ameretto. If you prefer to omit it completely, you can use just leave out the rum or add little bit vanilla extract.</p>
            
            <h2>What are LadyFingers?</h2>
            <p>Lady Fingers are essentially sponge cake batter piped into strips and baked. They are known as "savoiardi" in italian and are perfect for absorbing the syrup for tiramisu. Ladyfingers are great in other no-bake desserts such as the incredible Charlotte Cake, these individual Raspberry Mousse Cup, and even a Berry Triffle. </p>
            <p>Ladyfingers can be found at some grocery stores, like Trader Joe's, Walmart, Albertsons, and World Market, but it's easy to get Ladyfingers online.</p>

            <h2>Can I Substituted the Coffee?</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, coffee or espresso is used in Tiramisu. If you are concerned about caffeine, you can use decaf coffee and still enjoy the same classic flavor. If you prefer a different flavor profile, check out our Berry Tiramisu.</p>

            <h2>What is Mascarpone?</h2>
            <p>Mascarpone is essentially rhe italian version of cream cheese, made of whipped cream, stablili</p>
