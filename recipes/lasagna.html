        <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
        <p>This easy <strong>Lasagna Recipe</strong> is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version, and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
 
        <p>My love for lasagna runs deep, and I’ve heard over and over from our readers that this is the <strong>best lasagna recipe</strong> they’ve ever made.</p>

        <h2>Lasagna Video</h2>
        <p>In this video, I’ll show you how to make this classic Lasagna Recipe. It’s the best lasagna we have tried, with the perfect balance of meat sauce to three-cheese sauce and noodles. That golden cheese crust seals in all the flavor and makes it irresistible.</p>

        <h2>Seriously the Best Lasagna!</h2>
        <p>We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years with <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-soup-recipe/">Lasagna Soup</a>, <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-lasagna-recipe/">Chicken Lasagna</a>, and even <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chocolate-lasagna/">Chocolate lasagna</a> (does that count?).</p>
        <p>Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I’ve tried over the years, this is the perfect lasagna. We loved it so much, we even turned it into Lasagna Roll Ups and Zucchini Lasagna (which is gluten-free). It’s flavorful and satisfying but also easy to make.</p>
        <p>In our house, lasagna is a staple for busy school nights because it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well, and it’s nice to have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. I even use it for kids’ lunches—I pack a serving in my son’s thermos to keep it hot, and that thermos comes home empty every time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredient for Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This 3-cheese lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, and the ingredients are refrigerator and pantry staples. <i>See the recipe card below for exact quantities</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground beef</strong> – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic cloves</strong> – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
            <li><strong>Red wine</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Mariana sauce</strong> – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried thyme</strong> – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong> – balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>Pasrley</strong> – flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> – Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage cheese</strong> – adds great texture and moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> – we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong> – An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong> – helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pro Tip for Lasagna Nodles</h3>
        <p>Use a very large pot of salted water to boil the lasagna noodles and stir them several timesm especially right after adding them in the pot. This will keep them from sticking to each other and tearing.</p>

        <h2>How to Make the Meat Sauce</h2>
        <p>If you’d like to get a head start on this recipe, you can make the meat sauce a day or two in advance. That said, it’s still easy enough to make it all in one go, even for a weeknight dinner.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> – Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong> – Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
        </ol>
