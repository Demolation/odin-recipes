        <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
        <p>This easy <strong>Lasagna Recipe</strong> is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version, and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
 
        <p>My love for lasagna runs deep, and I’ve heard over and over from our readers that this is the <strong>best lasagna recipe</strong> they’ve ever made.</p>

        <h2>Lasagna Video</h2>
        <p>In this video, I’ll show you how to make this classic Lasagna Recipe. It’s the best lasagna we have tried, with the perfect balance of meat sauce to three-cheese sauce and noodles. That golden cheese crust seals in all the flavor and makes it irresistible.</p>

        <h2>Seriously the Best Lasagna!</h2>
        <p>We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years with <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-soup-recipe/">Lasagna Soup</a>, <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-lasagna-recipe/">Chicken Lasagna</a>, and even <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chocolate-lasagna/">Chocolate lasagna</a> (does that count?).</p>
        <p>Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I’ve tried over the years, this is the perfect lasagna. We loved it so much, we even turned it into <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-roll-ups/">Lasagna Roll Ups</a> and <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/zucchini-lasagna-recipe/">Zucchini Lasagna</a> (which is gluten-free). It’s flavorful and satisfying but also easy to make.</p>
        <p>In our house, lasagna is a staple for busy school nights because it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well, and it’s nice to have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. I even use it for kids’ lunches—I pack a serving in my son’s thermos to keep it hot, and that thermos comes home empty every time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredient for Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This 3-cheese lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, and the ingredients are refrigerator and pantry staples. <i>See the recipe card below for exact quantities</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground beef</strong> – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic cloves</strong> – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
            <li><strong>Red wine</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Mariana sauce</strong> – Use <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/marinara-sauce/">homemade marinara</a> or store-bought.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried thyme</strong> – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong> – balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>Pasrley</strong> – flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> – Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage cheese</strong> – adds great texture and moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> – we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong> – An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong> – helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box1"><h4>Pro Tip for Lasagna Nodles</h4></div>
        <p>Use a very large pot of salted water to boil the lasagna noodles and stir them several timesm especially right after adding them in the pot. This will keep them from sticking to each other and tearing.</p>

        <h2>How to Make the Meat Sauce</h2>
        <p>If you’d like to get a head start on this recipe, you can make the meat sauce a day or two in advance. That said, it’s still easy enough to make it all in one go, even for a weeknight dinner.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> – Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong> – Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Make the Cheese Sauce</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the cheese filling</strong> – Combine all the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep</strong> – Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente, then drain and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble</strong> – Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZFj7mZ">9×13-inch casserole dish</a>. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <o start="3">
            <li><strong>Bake</strong> – Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest</strong> – Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Pro Tip to Prevent Cheese Melting</h4>
        <p>There’s nothing worse than having the top portion of cheese stuck to the foil. To prevent this, I poke 8-10 toothpicks evenly around the top of the lasagna, pushing them in halfway to keep the foil from touching the cheese. Just be sure to count and remove every toothpick prior to serving.</p>

        <h2>Which is better for lasagna, cottage cheese or riccotta?</h2>
        <p>I use both; cottage cheese is healthier, and ricotta is creamier, so you get the best of both worlds by using both of these cheeses in your lasagna. I admit cottage cheese isn’t traditional for Italian lasagna, so if that upsets you, you’ll love the classic Italian-style lasagna in my <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/natashas-kitchen-cookbook-cover-reveal/">Cookbook</a></p>

        <h2>What is “al dente”?</h2>
        <p>Cooking al dente pasta means it should be “firm to the bite.” The package instructions will provide the cook time for pasta to reach al dente. Keep in mind, the lasagna will be baked for 45 minutes so it’s better if your noodles are undercooked.</p>

        <h2>What is the best marinara sauce for lasagna?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/marinara-sauce/">Homemade marinara</a> is definitely best, but if you don’t have time to make it, use your favorite store-bought marinara sauce. A high-quality sauce like Rao’s is a good bet, but here’s a fun article about the <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/chef-approved-jarred-pasta-sauce-brands-23086904">best Marinara Sauces</a>.</p>

        <h2>Can I double the lasagna recipe?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can easily double this recipe, but you’ll need to bake the lasagna in two pans unless you have a freakishly large casserole dish. Doubling the recipe is a nice way to make one ahead (stash it in the freezer, or share it with someone).</p>
