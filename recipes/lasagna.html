        <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
        <p>This easy <strong>Lasagna Recipe</strong> is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version, and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
 
        <p>My love for lasagna runs deep, and I’ve heard over and over from our readers that this is the <strong>best lasagna recipe</strong> they’ve ever made.</p>

        <h2>Lasagna Video</h2>
        <p>In this video, I’ll show you how to make this classic Lasagna Recipe. It’s the best lasagna we have tried, with the perfect balance of meat sauce to three-cheese sauce and noodles. That golden cheese crust seals in all the flavor and makes it irresistible.</p>

        <h2>Seriously the Best Lasagna!</h2>
        <p>We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years with <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-soup-recipe/">Lasagna Soup</a>, <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-lasagna-recipe/">Chicken Lasagna</a>, and even <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chocolate-lasagna/">Chocolate lasagna</a> (does that count?).</p>
        <p>Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I’ve tried over the years, this is the perfect lasagna. We loved it so much, we even turned it into Lasagna Roll Ups and Zucchini Lasagna (which is gluten-free). It’s flavorful and satisfying but also easy to make.</p>
        <p>In our house, lasagna is a staple for busy school nights because it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well, and it’s nice to have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. I even use it for kids’ lunches—I pack a serving in my son’s thermos to keep it hot, and that thermos comes home empty every time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredient for Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This 3-cheese lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, and the ingredients are refrigerator and pantry staples. <i>See the recipe card below for exact quantities</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground beef</strong> – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic cloves</strong> – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
            <li><strong>Red wine</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Mariana sauce</strong> – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
