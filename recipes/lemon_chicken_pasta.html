            <h2>Lemon Chicken Pasta</h2>
            <p>I can’t count how many times I’ve gone into a restaurant telling myself I’ll just order salad until I find creamy chicken pasta on the menu and all self-restraint goes out the window. Being a major fan of creamy pasta, this one does not disappoint!</p>
            <p>We took our classic creamy alfredo sauce from our Shrimp Pasta, and replaced the white wine with fresh lemon juice. The lemon juice lightens up the sauce and makes it vibrant. It goes so well with the crispy lemon chicken.</p>
            <p>My 9-year-old son developed this lemon chicken several years ago while experimenting with Popcorn Chicken. It’s a simple 3-step process that results in a crisp and juicy chicken. You can use chicken breast cutlets or chicken tenders.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>This is essentially a creamy Alfredo sauce that is lightened up with lemon juice. The fresh lemon adds a vibrant tanginess to the sauce and is a game-changer for Alfredo. We then proceed to squeeze fresh lemon juice over the chicken and the two marry beautifully. I’m hungry just writing about it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong> – helps keep the sauce from separating and adds richness to the sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh garlic</strong> and onion powder – add amazing flavor</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong> lightens up the cream sauce and be sure to use fresh lemon juice for best results. You’ll need more to squeeze over the chicken.</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy Whipping cream</strong> – luxuriously smooth</li>
                <li><strong>Shredded parmesan cheese</strong> or freashly grated</li>
                <li><strong>Sea Salt</strong>– always taste the finished sauce and season with salt to taste</li>
                <li><strong>Pasta</strong> – we use Fettuccini noodles because the sauce coats them so well and they have a terrific bite to them when cooked to Al’dente.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Make Lemon Chicken Pasta</h2>
            <p>This recipe is 2 parts: Creamy Pasta and Crispy Chicken. If you start prepping the chicken while your pasta cooks, this can be a 30-minute meal.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Boil Water</b> – fill a pot with water and bring to a boil, then generously salt the water (it should taste like ocean water), and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.</li>
                <li><b>Dip</b> chicken cutlets into egg wash (egg+milk)</li>
                <li><b>Coat</b> chicken in bread crumb mixture(panko bread crumbs + salt + pepper)</li>
                <li><b>Sautee</b> ina large skillet and squeeze lemon juice </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Secret to Perfect Alfredo Sauce</h2>
            <p>Had you ever made a grainy, curdled, or lumpy alfredo sauce? This lemon alfredo sauce is so simple to make but removing it from the heat after adding the cheese <b> is KEY</b>. As with any Alfredo sauce, If you continue boiling after adding parmesan, the sauce can curdle and become gritty.</p>
            <p>Also, the secret to making a LEMON cream sauce is to whisk constantly while adding the lemon juice so the cream doesn’t separate.</p>

            <h2>Make-Ahead</h2>
            <p>In the rare situation that you end up with leftover lemon chicken pasta, you’ll be happy to know there are several effective ways to reheat a creamy pasta:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>On the Stove:</b> Place in a saucepan over medium-low heat and warm the pasta slowly, stirring frequently and adding more milk as needed to thin the sauce. Remove from heat once warmed through.</li>
                <li><b>In the Microwave: </b> You can microwave a bowl of pasta for 45-60 seconds, stirring every 15 seconds.</li>
                <li><b>Re-Crisp the Chicken</b> on a skillet or in the air fryer or toaster oven until crisp and heated through.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="protip">
                <p>Pro TIP: When reheating creamy pasta, always add a splash of milk (or reserved pasta cooking water), to loosen the cream since it will thicken as it cools. The trick is to heat low and slow and just until warmed through. If you overheat it, the cream will separate and turn buttery.</p>

            <p>Lemon chicken pasta is well-loved by everyone in our family. The combination of creamy lemon alfredo pasta topped with crispy-juicy chicken is really irresistibly good. Don’t forget that squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the top. You could even add some lemon zest for another punch of flavor!</p>
